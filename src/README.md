# Goal

Excercise your overall coding skills by extending this application. This application represents in a large part a simplified version of our application stack. Proving that you can find your way around this code base, while navigating the amount of OSS code involved will help demonstrate your capabilties to our team.

# Requirements:

- Extend the 'Name' field to 'First Name' and 'Last Name'
- Present the 'Pizza Type' in another fashion than a dropdown
- Capture an additional required field 'Phone Number' from the user.
  - Phone number should be implemented as a micro type
  - using a Html Convention present the phone number as a series of three boxes
- You MUST support: IE8 and later, FireFox (latest), and Chrome (latest)
- When you send us your code:
  - We will run this command: `rake`
  - We expect the last few lines of the output to look something like this:
    
    ```
    Tests run: XX, Errors: 0, Failures: 0, Inconclusive: 0, Time: 0.6510372 seconds
      Not run: 0, Invalid: 0, Ignored: 0, Skipped: 0
    ```

# Optionals:

- You MAY enhance the UI how ever you like.

#Notes

- Do NOT fork this repo unless you don't mind it being public. This is to protect your privacy.
- Clone this repo.
- once you have cloned locally, run 'git submodule update --init'
- then run 'rake' -- from here on out it should build in visual studio
- You may use whatever tools you like to develop and test -- but we will run 'rake' to compile and test your code
- Commit your work to your local repository in a branch (you pick the name, just let us know)
- You can send your work back to us in a ZIP file via email, as a git patch via email, a dropbox shared folder, or whatever else you think is appropriate.
