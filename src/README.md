# Goal

Excercise your overall coding skills by extending this application. This application represents in a large part a simplified version of our application stack. Proving that you can find your way around this code base, while navigating the amount of OSS code involved will help demonstrate your capabilties to our team.

# Requirements:

- Extend the 'Name' field to 'First Name' and 'Last Name'
- Present the 'Pizza Type' in another fashion than a dropdown
- Capture an additional required field 'Phone Number' from the user.
- - Phone number should be implemented as a micro type
- - using a Html Convention present the phone number as a series of three boxes
- You MUST support: IE8 and later, FireFox (latest), and Chrome (latest)

# Optionals:

- You MAY enhance the UI how ever you like.

#Notes

- once you have cloned the project run 'git submodule update --init'
- then run 'rake' -- from here on out it should build in visual studio
- 'rake' is what will run to test your project.
