# Goal

- The player moves disks one at a time by dragging and dropping them to the other "poles".
- A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## Tasks
- Implement drag-n-drop to let the user play the game
- Prevent the user from dragging a larger disk onto a smaller disk
- Indicate to the user when they have won the game
- Do something (code related) to impress us
